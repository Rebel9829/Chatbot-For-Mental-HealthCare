Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character intelligence or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective with 7090 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life.

Close your eyes slowly count to four as you inhale and exhale\\xa0even slower counting to 6. Focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes.3. Stop any negative thoughts in their tracks. Often times when we get upset we catastrophize and do not see things clearly. When you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational. If you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid then let them go and replace them with realistic logical thoughts.4.

It's likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old tender bruised emotion that we've simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions and anger is one way of doing that.\\xa0So when someone looks at you in a certain way or says something you'd rather be angry than feel powerless or unimportant or whatever your kryptonite feeling is.

In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways. If a man never learns to say “I am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern.\\xa0It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset.

If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 510 seconds then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private and feel safe environment.

But can and does come with practice.Having gone through two masters programs I can sympathize with your your dilemma.\\xa0So how is the stress affecting you?Is it serious enough to stop you from presenting or is it just \"butterflies\"?There are many ways of dealing with the anxiety and stress. Much depends on how serious the stress is.So here are a few ideas:1. Practice in front of a mirror.Sounds strange but the practice helps.2. Ask some friends to listen to your presentations.\\xa0Not so much for their input as to just get used to presenting.3. Focus on the material you are presenting.\\xa0The subject matter is what you want to get across. Step away from your nerves and get into the facts you want to present. Let the material you present be the focus.\\xa04. Remember everyone else is just as nervous as you.\\xa0Share your fears with some of your classmates and gain support from them. Focus on a friendly face during the presentation. Be a support to them in return.5. \"Fake it till you make it\".\\xa0Yes it sounds blunt.\\xa0But sometimes that\\'s what it takes. Even if you feel like it you won\\'t die.So much more can be discussed with a competent counselor. Take the time to let a professional help you work through this.Again you have come a long way to be in a graduate program. Congratulations you have done great work so far. It\\'s just one step at a time take the steps.'),\n",

Sleep problems including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about are really common for people and so many people suffer from them. Here are a few things to consider or to try: 1. Have you changed\\xa0or started taking any new medication lately? Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams. If you are taking a new medication talk to your provider about the nightmares this may be the cause. 2. Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states. The dreams may not make much sense but then again even good dreams don\\'t always make much sense. Ask yourself do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life? Work school relationships health.... all of these areas\\xa0and many more are places where stress can hide out. If this is the case talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help. 3. Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something we can begin to obsess about it. My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you. Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed. This could increase your chances of having another bad dream. Try relaxation techniques before going to bed. If you have YouTube you can pull up \"Guided Meditation for Sleep\" exercises to help you relax. There are many different ones to choose from. You may also want to try deep breathing.4. There are selfhelp ideas for managing bad nightmares. If you Google search \"Nightmare Rescripting\" or \"Nightmare Exposure\" you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams. I hope these ideas help. Be well... Robin J.

              "  'Hello! Thank you for your question. There are few things that people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feel connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread. However if we feel disconnected in some way sex can feel degrading and even painful.  I don’t know the specifics about your relationship or how comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend but this is one of those situations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception to that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. If you believe that then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds like there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case then remaining safe is your top priority.  Assuming you are able to share with him your feelings telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate and sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for all parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say “no” to absolutely anything they are not comfortable with.  I call the respectful agreement between sexual partners “sex trust.” Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means they won’t degrade you sexually with hurtful words forced sex or forcing or coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having. \\xa0Your personal safety and mental wellbeing is what is most important.  Now if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you can explore to learn information. I will warn you some websites and articles are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed.  Many people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships but again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is also important to know that BDSM is not\\xa0just one thing and people practice it differently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with then you shouldn’t feel obligated to do it. \\xa0 I hope this was helpful. Be well. \\xa0 Robin J. Landwehr DBH LPC NCC'),\n",

To decrease your anxiety symptoms it’s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation; engaging in deep breathing exercises; yoga practice; or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious. For example: \"I don\\'t need to worry I am calm and relaxed\". 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example: leaving the house; presenting in front of others; going to social events; and having conversations with people. However the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills ex. deep breathing the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful.

Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; there\\'s a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you and that\\'s healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. I\\'ll give you some tips.First remind yourself that it\\'s her job to learn what the rules are and where her power is. Don\\'t be so surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own we\\'re less caught off guard when it happens.\\xa0Avoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter \"do this now\" you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that she\\'s young enough you can pick her up; now is the time to teach her that mom\\'s or dad\\'s word means something. So if you say \"let\\'s get you dressed\" then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen you can make it happen. And I\\'m talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles; only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear give her two choices. Here\\'s an example...she\\'s on the ipad and you say ipad time is over. She says \"no\". You can say \"ipad time is over. If you put it down you can play later. If I have to take it away you don\\'t play it later.\" The choice is hers. Then follow through.\"When...then\" statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no try \"as soon as the toys are picked up we can have a snack\". You\\'re simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it.\\xa0Staying calm yourself is the key because then at least you will feel in control of yourself which is the ultimate goal. Use selftalk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted and it will be over by the time the breath is done.

              "  'Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do but here\\'s a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don\\'t pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way i.e. scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen he wrote the book Buddha\\'s Brain\" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way but I don\\'t have time to go into all of that in this response. So it\\'s just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories \\xa0this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.'),\n",

              "  'Hello and thank you for your question. Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do. I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest:1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like \"I want to be more confident\" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior decide what you are going to do in place of it. So if you are going to stop showing up late for work then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example if you have the goal of weight loss the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value selfcare. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So make the goal small realistic and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. 5. As Sherry mentioned finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. Any counselor who does work with goalsetting and motivation can probably help.

Of course these plans can also change due to internal what we have control over like our thoughts feelings and behaviours or external reasons those things that are outside our control.

If you feel sad on most days it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss whether you lose a family friend job or something you deem important in your life. However feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our selfesteem and selfworth then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected disregarded or feel unimportant?

              "  \"Hello. So someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a person's life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary. Even relationships fo not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problem.What I would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.I wish you happiness for every day of your life.Best wishes.\"),\n",

              " (\"My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn't be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.\",\n",

Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of \"tools\" to manage them accordingly. For example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time.\\xa0Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress. For example does a certain person\\'s style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity? \\xa0Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.'),\n",

You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal.

Medication is not the only way to treat depression but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2.

I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.\",\n",

I\\'m glad you wrote this question because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes.\\xa0I can tell that you\\'re smart because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you \"not being yourself\" and then how you felt when your grandma died.\\xa0When Grandma died you needed and deserved extra love and support but the people around you didn\\'t seem to give it to you maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to but that they didn\\'t know how much you needed it or what you needed exactly. The older you get the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature but that\\'s how it works.\\xa0When you started middle school it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet right? That must have felt weird to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn\\'t like you. Fear can be silly. So then fear got you to not show yourself and when we don\\'t show ourselves people can\\'t see who we are; they don\\'t know us as well and then they don\\'t know what we need and they can\\'t care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you.

Was it ended just because of the distance or are there more differences between you that didn\\'t work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can\\'t clearly see that the other person isn\\'t in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she\\'s asked for distance you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they\\'re getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or \"If I move forward that will mean...\" \\xa0Keep going...what would be the worst part of that? \\xa0This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you\\'ve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in \"If this person doesn\\'t love me then I\\'m unlovable\" or \"No one will ever love me as much as she did\".

There is evidence of that.It\\'s part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that\\'s how I know I\\'m lovable.It\\'s normal to feel sad.

I know that today\\'s culture for young people is more of a \"hookup\" culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women I\\'m not sure you\\'re female but that\\'s my guess say that they struggle with hookups because they can\\'t let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup. Research tells us that after a hookup college age women tend to feel used and unworthy and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it\\'s okay to want or expect that.Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that something\\'s wrong with us or something bad\\'s going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague it\\'s more difficult to refute it then but you can try to clarify it\\'s whisperings by asking yourself these questions: What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? Might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?Then when you find that core fear you can look at your life and I bet you\\'d find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment or many smaller ones when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end it\\'s a feeling you\\'re trying to avoid not life or relationship and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this doesn\\'t work for you! Good! With the help of a qualified therapist you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence.'),\n",

For instance here is an example:A Action or Event: You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B Behavior or Response: You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C Consequence: You feel depressed.If you look at the model B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A then C will have a better consequence such as:A: stays the same.B this is what you change: This person must be busy they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve.

This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT.\\xa0There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept. A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change such as the recent death of a loved one a lost relationship or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped. In cases like this what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression. Other people seem to be able to handle life’s ups and downs and bounce back. They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. “You are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made. You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes.” Another quote I like is “You will find a way or you will find an excuse.” Don’t ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing but you do have choices. Not happy in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters to you you will find a way. Don’t sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better.Take care of yourself. Exercise is very important not only for your physical health but for your mental health as well. Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself.

I was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when I was in middle school. His mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my mom’s house, and I was so awe-stricken with my dad that I got to stay with him for a long time. Meanwhile, I did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs. My mom went to prison for that and lost her café. We live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and I was bullied because of who my parents were. My dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison.\\n   My mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that person’s house. My parents did not get along at this point. We were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out. He got out of the car, went to the driver’s side, and punched my mom in the face. I got out and told him not to hit my mom. At that point, I was really scared and mad that he did that, so I ran towards him to stop him. He literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road. I couldn't even walk. My mom tried to help me, but he started choking her. I hobbled over, and she barely got into the car, and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance. He was so badly strung out on drugs. He went to prison again and seems to be doing well. I met up with him once with my grandma, and we had coffee, but he's so hard to handle. I think a lot of it is that I can't bring myself to forgive him. My mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, I moved in with my dad’s mom (the one who lived just down the road) because I trust her, her house is stable, and she's more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents. I also stay at my boyfriend’s a lot. Now that my mom is out of prison, she's trying to control every aspect of my life. She’s trying to make me move back home out of Susan's house, and I don't want to. I don't like it there. They condone drug abuse and many other things, and I'm just not comfortable. She's even threatened to call the police and say I'm a runaway because she has custody of me. My boyfriend has always had this picture-perfect life, and his family are strict Christians. One time, his mom even went as far as to say that if he and I break up, if we were having sex, I would say that he raped me. I've got so many problems I don't even know what to do.\",\n",

Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom\\'s acknowledgment) and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend\\'s houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous \"you\\'re doing it wrong—do it this way\" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that\\'s when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me.

Focus on what you can do differently next time. What emotions or situations led up to the binge? What can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge or the way that you handled the situation?\\xa0Lastly if you\\'re struggling with \"normalizing\" eating it can be helpful to work with a professional that can provide counseling and coaching to help you learn how to eating normally mindfully and without feeling the guilt and other harmful emotions sometimes associated with disordered eating.

              " (\"I have no self control over food. Most people stop when they've had enough, but I keep eating for the pleasure of it. Especially with sweets - I'm never done eating dessert.\",\n",
              "  'Hello! I\\'m so glad you decided to write in today. This is such a great question and I\\'m sure many others will relate to exactly what you\\'re describing. There are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern.\\xa0First I think it\\'s important to understand food is just food. Food is meant to nourish our bodies provide us with energy and yes sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations. But in many cultures we place a LOT of emphasis on food. We have food at every gathering and every celebration. What\\'s more people have come to almost EXPECT food to be present at any and every gettogether. And if it\\'s not? Well then forget about it!\\xa0I see this time and time again with my clients. Donuts appear in the office and it\\'s almost like donuts have never been there before! Must eat one or two!\\xa0However we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence or similar ones will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food. It is likely the office donuts have happened before and they will be there again on another day. During these moments I like to have my clients employ a StopandThink method. StopandThink about your goals before you eat. Is this donut getting you where you want to be? Also I have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut? If the donut really is a special donut from the best bakery in town and you\\'ve never been there before then now might be a time to have the donut. But if not it would be wise to pass and wait until that \"special\" donut.\\xa0Another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what we\\'re getting from overindulging or overeating. Are you trying to drown out other emotions? Are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment? What ELSE is going on? This can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a Thought Record. A Thought Record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers. By targeting the emotions we can then determine where they\\'re coming from as well as how to decipher them. A therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the Thought Record.The most important thing to remember is that \"food addiction\" can be a real problem for a lot of people. If food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start please seek out help. Binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands.\\xa0There are lots of free resources and information on my website at www.maddenwellnessky.com.

              "  'It is understandable that it\\'s very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece. You cannot change your mother\\'s feelings and responsibilities which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. It must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. This type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship living situation and the feeling of being \"abandoned.\"\\xa0Not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation. Nonetheless it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself.\\xa0It is likely that your mother\\'s \"complaints\" may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support. In this case you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain \"This must be very difficult for you because I hear the stress in your voice almost everyday. It\\'s very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed. I feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance.\" When empathy and understanding is communicated recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help.After sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you. This means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother andor niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed. This could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite. You could then say to her if she complains again \"I cannot change the way you feel in this situation and I encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what I could do is .........explain what you could do to help.\"www.PsychologyResource.ca'),\n",

I truly wish I\\xa0could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately I can't do that. Their acceptance of you\\xa0is a journey just like coming out is a journey for you. Sometimes families initially respond this way but after time they become more accepting and even supportive. Unfortunately there is no way to know for sure if that will happen. So here are a few things I would suggest:Surround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are. That won't take the place of your family's acceptance and I won't even pretend that it would but it may help during those days when it hurts the most. And that is really important. Patience is not something that many of us are really good at but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some. When families first learn something like this they may go through a period of shock. And then sometimes even grieving. They may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden. These things can take time for them to reconcile so it may just take some patience. If it is safe for you try to talk to them but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away. I do recommend setting up\\xa0some personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them. The reason I feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like you're describing. They may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around. They may or they may not. And if they don't you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are. To be surrounded by folks who remind you of that.\\xa0If you start\\xa0seeing this pattern and you are struggling chatting with\\xa0counselor may be a great idea.

If you search for \"transgender support\" on Google you\\'ll find GLAAD and PFLAG both of which are national organizations. This does not mean that you have to identify as \"transgender\" but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resources.As far as telling your dad if that is particularly concerning for you I suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time so that you can talk with some people to have support. This may help with two things: allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell him.One thing that I tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important conversation.

Being bisexual can be particularly difficult because it is often misunderstood even by people who are “supposed” to be part of your own community such as lesbians and gays. It happens so often that there is actually a term for it –\\xa0 bierasure. This is simply something that happens when people deny that bisexuality is a real thing or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs like your parents seem to have.  The unfortunate truth is that you can never be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information. It sounds promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations and it may simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality. With accurate information they may come around but there is no way to be sure.  Some of my colleagues have already given you good information. Here are some more\\xa0things that you can consider and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them: \\xa0 1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If they don’t respond the way you want them to have you developed a support system to support you through it? This is very important. The truth is that all the friends in the world won’t prevent pain or sadness if your parents don’t respond as you hope but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE okay as you are. And that is critical for you to remember.  \\xa0 2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can offer your parents if you think it would be helpful. It may be important for them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality. Here is an article from GLAAD about bierasure: http:www.glaad.orgbisexualbierasure \\xa0 3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take place when you are ready. Sometimes people get pressured from friends media and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are ready. It really is up to you. If you are feeling pressure from others don’t feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out on your own time. Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand this.  \\xa0 4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual. Just because someone is LGBTQ doesn’t mean that they necessarily want to be. Many people struggle with this. Having your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are in telling your parents. So perhaps do some selfexploration about your feelings toward yourself.  \\xa0 Sometimes people take friends with them when they decide to come out to their parents. This is something you may want to consider. The important thing to remember is that you are okay. Really. If your parents don’t respond well that doesn’t mean that they never will. Some start off upset but then work their way through it.  Best of luck to you.  Robin J. Landwehr DBH LPC NCC'),\n",

Some have told their parents directly some drop hints some have had others tell their parents etc. The only \"right\" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you.

Mom\\'s voice has no place in these arenas unless you are storing food in your room and it\\'s a health hazard.

What will happen if you don\\'t follow through? Write it all down so it\\'s really clear. It has to all be mutually agreed upon.The third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you and how you talk to her. You can let her know that you don\\'t want to be told what to do or when to do it; that doesn\\'t work when you\\'re 20 years old. Listen to what she wants too. Beyond the contract you\\'ve just written up anything else you want from each other is a request it\\'s optional and whether and when you do it is at your discretion.

Most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for 56 free counseling sessions your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them. Secondly I would advise you to take a minute and breathe. When confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama but sometimes that can compound our stress.

I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him.\\n   The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone.

I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children.\\xa0Children need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they don\\'t like each other; it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. Your exboyfriend\\xa0seems more focused on his own needs. In fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on \\'parental alienation\\'. I agree this is a problem.I also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. It\\'s not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. Honour this instinct you have.\\xa0I will suggest a few things to you. First to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband. If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help. He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. It will help you feel supported.Know that your ex\\'s behaviours aren\\'t happening because you did anything wrong; it\\'s the way he operates and maybe this is why you\\'re not with him?. You can\\'t change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. You\\'re correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.Keep on defining clear boundaries! You might sound like a broken record \"You\\'ll have to talk to my husband about that\" but that\\'s okay. It\\'s okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. It\\'s okay to not respond to texts or other communications that aren\\'t vitally important. It\\'s okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. It\\'s okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.Regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. Let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing \"our agreement states X and you are not following our agreement\". Your daughter doesn\\'t have to be aware; I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.A professional therapist can help you with all of this.

For one thing bills have to be paid.There are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order. You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced. Denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance are the stages.\\xa0At first people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone. This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually died.Then comes bargaining in which you may beg God that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever.\\xa0Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss. It sounds like you are stuck in this phase.Finally acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move on.When we lose someone we never forget them. We may always have certain days that are tough such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one. But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable and that life goes on.A therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it. One suggestion I have is not to try to run from the sad feelings don’t try to not feel them. Embrace the feelings. Let the feelings wash over you and accept them. Trying not to feel something is not going to help. Sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does. Unpleasant feelings are not to be avoided.I am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now. You deserve to be happy and to live a full life. I am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long. I wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief.'),\n",

Your partner needs to own his choices and if he is capable of doing it and is truly willing to work on the relationship with you to make it stronger more transparent and more fulfilling for both of you then there is hope.

It won't just happen if you don't work on it. And yes it's unfair that you are being asked to work on this when he is the one who had been unfaithful. Even though it is hard you need to be able to let go at some point of having all the power in the relationship because right now you have it as the one who had been cheated on. You cannot hold on to being the victim forever because it will create an imbalance in your relationship making it less healthy in the longrun. All of this is hard work.

When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What\\xa0kind of character\\xa0do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic and YOU also value\\xa0authenticity\\xa0as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay lesbian bisexual etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values\\xa0and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom but I won't lie it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all I wish you well in this journey.

We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and there\\'s a vulnerability in that; we can get hurt. Who you partner with longterm is a big decision and it determines 90% of our happiness in life.\\xa0The good news is that when we\\'re just starting to get to know someone we can take it slow. I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here and that\\'s okay. We are naturally people of attachment and it won\\'t likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesn\\'t put up walls. So part of what I want to say here is don\\'t pressure yourself too much. Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow. :As well there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down or will come down for the right person.\\xa0First think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship. What do you feel proud of? What do you need in a partner? What mistakes did you make? Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner.Look at your thoughts. Are you having generalized negative thoughts like \"No one will ever love me again?\" or \"I\\'m going to get hurt again\" or \"I can\\'t trust myself\"? If so write down what these thoughts are and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts. Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening!! It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence. Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought. What is the evidence that I am lovable... that there are safe good people out there... that I can trust myself? Eliminate the negative thoughts and add the positive ones. It\\'s simple but very powerful.Lastly take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls. What is the evidence of the walls? Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls? When we act as though something is true we start to feel it and believe it more.I hope you will find yourself back on track eventually with time. :'),\n",

My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that Are they going to have questions? I would imagine so.Are you comfortable answering questions?I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends or perhaps even with a therapist how you would answer these sorts of questions:What exactly is crossdressing?Does that change the gender that you're attracted to?What does it mean to you?Why is it important to you?And what you want your listening person to know about you related to crossdressing.There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.I certainly hope that you find the right person for you.

This is important because we all have different values and morals surrounding sex love and monogamy. If you value monogamous relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner then you may feel like you are living in contradiction to your values and most people are not happy when they do that. However if monogamy is not something you value then perhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is still right for you. Not all people want monogamous relationships and that is alright. Finally\\xa0if you value your husband’s feelings and know that the affairs would hurt him then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your own values. That can only be determined by you.  2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Based on how you describe your relationship it sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is.\\xa0 From the outside it looks like the affairs are a way to “get even” with your husband or to feel better after an argument. This is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a relationship and gets replaced with contempt. We can simply stop caring about how our actions hurt each other or potentially hurt each other. Perhaps the question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your husband is this the pattern that you want to keep? The pattern of very little sex argument and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs.  \\xa03.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What are your goals for this relationship? If we start to become disconnected in a relationship we can begin to do things on autopilot. Get up get the kids up go to work come home and go to bed. None of which requires any intimacy at all. Are you still able to see the hopes and dreams you once had for this relationship? \\xa04.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have you considered seeking marital counseling? Not having affairs won’t actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading you to have them. If there is something broken it sometimes requires some help to get it fixed.  \\xa0Hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship.

Have they cheated before? If not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. If it\\'s a \"yes\" then it\\'s natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. \"When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that you\\'re hiding something. I need openness\". If they haven\\'t cheated on you in the past there are three possible scenarios here. I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. What is the specific thing that\\'s triggering your fears? When you have your data recorded read on...The first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you\\'ve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you\\'re not enough to keep someone interested this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons not because we\\'re not interesting. This may be true if what you wrote down is \"They didn\\'t really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. I\\'m just scared and suspicious\". That\\'s a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like \"nothing has really happened. I can trust.\"If what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or you\\'re having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. Trust your gut but your gut isn\\'t seeing evidence of cheating...it\\'s evidence of \"something\". Ask your partner what\\'s up with accusations or assumptions.The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. Maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw. I\\'d say when there is some evidence it\\'s okay to present this to your partner and ask what\\'s going on. If this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don\\'t make sense then it\\'s okay to do a bit of \"research\" and be extra aware of what\\'s going on around you.\\xa0I hope that helps.'),\n",

If you both want the relationship to improve a couple's therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea; it's a complex picture that you've only given us a glimpse of.In the meantime you can try a few things: have compassion for your wife. She's in pain and this may preoccupy her. Sex may be uncomfortable for her. She needs understanding. You need understanding too right? \\xa0Help her to see that you're not just angry but lonely and hurt; it might affect how you see yourself as a man. Showing her irritability or anger might push her farther away.There are many ways to be close intimate and sexual that don't involve intercourse. You might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you won't pressure her to have intercourse. Find out what your wife's wishes and ideas are. You might be surprised.These things take time to address especially if they've been years in the making. I do recommend seeing that therapist.

I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes. However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust. My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again. During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with. But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child.\\n   The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her. He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away). He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too. He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since. Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can’t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual. Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time. He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything. He said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time. He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him. He's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because I'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.\\n   I'm of course hurt and in shock. I feel like I have to make a decision on whether I want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away. Both of these decisions are really hard to make because I feel like whether I stay or go, my heart will still be torn apart.

Basically if you want to feel differently more trusting in your case you look at your thoughts and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits they don\\'t reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like \"everyone cheats\" or \" you\\'re not enough for him\". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought there won\\'t be much...perhaps none and what is the evidence that doesn\\'t support it I know lots of good men I know I deserve love and loyalty there is no sign of infidelity.... You\\'re learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That\\'s the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate and the less you check the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel.

In the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing it is a good idea to be checked for STD’s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don’t like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I don’t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly don’t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just don’t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though.\\xa0If your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go. Don’t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment. I don’t see that you have done anything wrong. If you aren’t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him.

Your sexuality is YOURS and yours alone. It can be quite frustrating and hurful when others try to define who you are. And it can be equally frustrating when you are trying to figure it out for yourself. The truth is that there are many different possibilities when it comes to sexual orientation. It may help to think about what qualities you find attractive. What kind of person can you see yourself being attracted to? Someone smart? Funny? Loves dogs? If you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex but maybe not. At least you would be choosing someone based on values and qualities that you love and admire. Another idea is to chat with a counselor if you are interested. Preferrably one who has done some training in affirmative therapy. Be well and be you..Robin\\xa0 J. Landwehr DBH LPC NCC\"),\n",

If you have never had these feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew about yourself.  My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this started is likely a coincidence but I understand how you would make the connection.  I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It is really hard to say since I don’t know you how old you are etc. But I will share you with you some thoughts.  Some people when they have undesirable thoughts that really surprise them have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction to the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out stuff it avoid it etc. is not always successful. In fact it’s usually not.  It’s like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now.  So rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity and without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution about what is going on.  One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them but another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe that it is second possibility. And that is okay.  You can try some of my suggestions but you can also see a counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You can usually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What is important is that you find someone who is nonjudgmental about what you are experiencing.  \\xa0 I wish you well.

He has four other children, three of which are from his first wife. He decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant. The children do not have a good relationship with him now. He has another child from a woman he was dating. He decided he didn't want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant.    It seems to me that there is a pattern. He easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the child's life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. I've tried to research online, but I'm not getting any answers.

It would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldn't repeat the same mistake.

What does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit? There are many possible goals this child might have in mind.

He\\'s likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you and he\\'s not considering how it\\'s affecting the kids. I\\'ve seen this happen in many families; parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. In some cases children actually stop having contact with one parent who is left bewildered and powerless. It\\'s your ex\\'s job to support your relationship with your kids not try to destroy it.\\xa0While you can\\'t change his behaviours and I think you know that there are things you can do for yourself and your kids.\\xa0For your children you can refuse to enter into the war he\\'s setting up. He\\'s trying to provoke you into acting \"crazy\" but you don\\'t have to fall for this. If you run around screaming \"he\\'s lying!\" it only makes you look more \\'crazy\\'. Try to stay calm and don\\'t put their dad down to them no matter how tempting it is. One day they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask. Trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he doesn\\'t have the power to destroy their love for you. Children in the long term lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. They see who their dad is already I\\'d bet but they don\\'t know how to cope with that. If he\\'s the only one fighting a war you\\'re helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. Don\\'t engage on his level.\\xa0Don\\'t blame your children completely. Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don\\'t need to tolerate that disrespect try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. They are acting out their father\\'s agenda likely because they instinctively see his weakness. Children often support the weaker parent rather than abandon them. You get the worst because they trust your love. But you can still have boundaries. Letting them abuse you isn\\'t the answer but have compassion for their position. This picture isn\\'t their fault but as adults they can be held accountable for their choices.Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. You don\\'t need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. Hold onto the likelihood that some day they will come back and be grateful.

The more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other.\\xa0One exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is \"active listening\" where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding.

Instead try thinking of getting past these feelings as grieving over the loss of someone even though someone didn\\'t die there is still a significant loss you are experiencing and therefore how essential it is to allow yourself to grieve to feel whatever feelings of anger or sadness or something else that you are feeling. Often it is really helpful to speak those feelings I recommend professionals in this case who can help you feel like you are not pathological for this struggle and instead that it is completely normal. Love is a crazy thing and the feelings can get very confusing. But the last stage of grieving is \"acceptance\" and it is very challenging to get there if you skip over denial anger bargaining and depression.'),\n",

Sometimes it\\'s tough even when we are 100% sure that it is the right thing to do!I am going to give you some of my thoughts and hopefully some colleagues will add some others. One of the things that I want to point out is that \"letting go\" is not really a thing. In other words it\\'s not really something you can reach out and grab. It\\'s more of a process. This is good news because you don\\'t necessarily have to be at\\xa0the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship. We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over. For example someone can end an unhealthy relationship today but then be reminded of the good times on what would\\xa0have been their \"anniversary.\" This could make the person very sad. They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while. It would important then for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end and that they are healthier because of it. This is relevant for you. It\\'s hard to walk away from a relationship. We fear all kinds of things including being single! Sometimes it\\'s helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship. It\\'s helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship. It\\'s fine to admit uncertainly about ending things. It\\'s okay to be afraid. It\\'s okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt. And even with all of that\\xa0someone\\xa0can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them. They can have sadness later on and still not go back.It sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce.

If you don\\'t want contact from this person it\\'s really important to give him clear messages about boundaries \"Don\\'t contact me again\" and then ignore all of their communications.

I hear you doing that already when you say \"he has nothing to offer me\". That\\'s great selftalk.But let\\'s get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. Sometimes it\\'s because we still hope they will change. Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those \"good old days\". The problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less. So what they\\'re eventually showing you is who they are and what they\\'re capable of. People do change and grow but it won\\'t happen at your pace. Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change.\\xa0Another reason we can\\'t let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. This is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. It\\'s as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts; maybe make up for past mistakes. You deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasn\\'t demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy.\\xa0It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someone\\'s poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. It will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behaviours.Draw a line.

              " (\"I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. I have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant. I’m coping as best as I can. Is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be? I am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesn't care, as well as most other people in my life. I feel like I don't exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who I thought cared about me. My brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. I am losing faith in humanity itself.\",\n",
              "  'I am very sorry to hear of your struggles. I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years so try not to be too hard on yourself. Take it one day at a time and do the best you can.I notice that you said he left you. This tells me that you didn’t have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. Low selfesteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can’t do any better. Also abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get. The way I see it he did you a favor. You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be.\\xa0Take this time alone to work on you. As hurtful as it may be that other people don’t want to help you this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you. Your statement “I don’t feel like I exist anymore” tells me that in addition to low selfesteem you also don’t have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are. People can and will let you down. It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment learn to take care of your own needs and to gain a stronger sense of self.\\xa0Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath do something that makes you feel good. Find a hobby that you enjoy. Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily. Google “positive affirmations” to find some that resonate with you. Such statements might be “I am a good person who deserves to be happy” or “I can do this.” Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well. There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google search.Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing. When you are a happier more stable person the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them. Good luck with rebuilding your life. I know it is hard! Remember to take it one day at a time.'),\n",

Quite honestly the brain can\\'t help it. It sees something good looking and it pays attention. And when we pay attention to something good our brains send out neurochemicals associated with that happy thought...and we get a rush of what your girlfriend is labeling \"a crush.\" The difficulty here is deciphering whether she was just attempting to honor her commitment to you by sharing this feeling OR if she is continuing to feed those feelings. I would encourage you to thank her for being honest if you haven\\'t already and ask her to further describe the nature of these feelings and what she\\'d like to do from here.

              "  'Hello. The dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear. Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind. When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return. Is the person afraid of being alone? Are they jealous of your current relationship? Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended? How long andor how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner? Does your former partner not like being \"dumped\" and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can \"dump\" you instead? Some of these questions you may not be able to answer and some of them might require your own internal reflection.You likely want to make a good decision and you also might want to consider who it will impact and how that will happen. Other friends might be upset at this sudden change and it could create a strain on your friendship. You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it. Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place. Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance? How it will it impact your current relationship?Going into relationships should be done with reflection patience and full awareness. Ultimately you choose who is in your life so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making and with the ability to protect yourself from harm. No one else can make this choice for you. However gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist. In your heart you will likely find the right answer. Learn to trust that more as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it. Use your mind to analyze things but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too. The answer will arrive if you let it.'),\n",

These questions help couples to build connection and trust. It's based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason support openess understanding empathy you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. Either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. If he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca\"),\n",

Although maintaining a longdistance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many longdistance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection.\\xa0Without knowing more about the \"complicated\" nature of your relationship I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else. Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him? \\xa0Or is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on \"what if\" situations the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure.\\xa0However if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a longdistance relationship. To help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. Is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment? For many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and Skype.

I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match. We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. He’s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. They're supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too.    I don't know what to do. I need some closure or I'm not going to be able to move on from this. I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. I’m so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He’s such a good person. I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head. I'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can't sleep because my mind is racing. I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.\\n   I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I don't want to.\\n   Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do.\",\n",

Although you say you're happy I'd suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you're getting everything you need. Is there a physical connection with your ex that you don't have with your current boyfriend? It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. That's a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You can't have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. The grass isn't greener... A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future.\"),\n",

Many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling. These services are ordinarily offered free of charge to members.Another option might be to explore support groups within the area.

Wow this sounds like a sticky situation; however I’m here to help guide you through this decision.\\xa0First and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons’ father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child. It’s very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because “it’s the right thing to do.” Right? Well not entirely. Although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run. If you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating. When a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions & behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such. As a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child. Just remember what you do your child will model.\\xa0Secondly do not sell yourself short from love. Everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with. However being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky. Honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love. Humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need. If you decide to pursue the second relationship I would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days.\\xa0Finally I am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys. This seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your child’s father or not. You should ask yourself if you were in love with your child’s father first off. If you were you would have never sought after love. I hope this was helpful for you and I hope I was able to shed a different light on your situation. Take care of yourself!'),\n",

That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her.

It takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be you will end up back together again.

Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?\",\n",
              "  'Hello and let me say first what a great question!\\xa0There are so many people putting forth their 100% everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve. Without being able to fully understand where you\\'re question is coming from I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question.First I think it\\'s important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that you\\'re \"not good enough.\" Is that ACTUALLY what they said or is this just what you heard? Sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others. Again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective. Is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern? If so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time you\\'re spending on being \"good enough.\" Explore with them how you feel you\\'r already giving your best.If the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship. Some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic. It may be they have their own \"stuff\" going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better. If you\\'re in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well. Explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life. If it\\'s a relationship that MUST continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems. Until they\\'re willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation.\\xa0Another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why it\\'s important for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals? NO ONE will ever be 100% \"good enough\" for EVERYONE. Every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others. It would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives.\\xa0The question becomes what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these expectations? There is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels \"less than\" and feels as if you yourself are not good enough. It then becomes impossible to every feel \"good enough\" for others because it\\'s really YOU you\\'re trying to feel good enough for. If you already feel as if you\\'re doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on LETTING GO of the rest. No one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress. Find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of what\\'s left. After all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrow!I recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection. The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation.\\xa0I leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra \"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. \"  Eleanor Roosevelt.'),\n",

The grief process of anger denial despair and acceptance may be a part of what is keeping you feeling \"stuck\" in a cycle of not feeling motivated to find work at this time. \\xa0Perhaps your mind is constantly fighting this grief? Death can be a \"traumatic\" experience for some people and is considered a great loss thus the grief process may continue to be a part of your world for a time but hopefully not keep you \"stuck\" on a longterm basis. \\xa0I would try to reach out to a counselor to discuss this grief process at a deeper level to discern whether her death is part of why you feel this way. \\xa0Grief and loss can also have an effect on your selfesteem. \\xa0Can you begin to see how this cycle is what you may be experiencing?\\xa0One positive I see is that you are continuing to look for a new job! \\xa0Take time to give yourself some credit for the \\xa0time you are spending looking for work. \\xa0Also I would recommend you set some shortterm goals first for example make a list of 510 potential new employers and send them each your resume.
